# Identity Chain: Decentralised Identity Verification System

## Project Vision
This project was started with the idea to tackle the issues of identity verification in the digital world. In a world where digital interactions are increasingly fraught with privacy concerns and security breaches, I propose a departure from centralised systems. My mission was to redefine identity verification through a framework that is inherently secure, decentralised, and privacy-respecting.

## Concept
I introduce a decentralised, blockchain-based identity verification system that operates on the zero-knowledge proof mechanism. This innovation allows users to verify their identity online without revealing any personal information, potentially changing the way we approach online interactions, digital signatures, and online voting.

## Script 
The heart of this system is a single, comprehensive Python script that integrates advanced cryptographic operations with web-based interactions. This script not only handles the cryptographic logic and blockchain interactions but also serves the web interface directly to the user.

### Python Script with Embedded Web Interface
- Generates RSA public-private key pairs for secure communications.
- Creates zero-knowledge proofs to enable identity verification without revealing personal information.
- Simulates interaction with a blockchain for secure and verifiable credential storage.
- Serves an HTML page with embedded JavaScript, providing a user interface directly from the Flask application.
- Allows users to initiate and complete the verification process through the web interface it provides.

The Python script utilises Flask to create an HTTP server that responds to web requests. The embedded JavaScript within the HTML page makes AJAX calls to the Python backend, enabling a seamless user experience without the need for separate frontend and backend servers.

## Novel Aspects
- **Decentralisation**: By moving away from traditional centralised verification authorities, we empower individuals to take control of their digital identities.
- **Privacy by Design**: The adoption of zero-knowledge proofs ensures privacy is not an afterthought but a foundational feature.
- **Interoperability**: This system is built to challenge the fragmented nature of current digital identity systems and to work across different platforms.

## Reasoning
- **Security and Privacy**: These are the non-negotiable cornerstones of our system. I start from the obvious principle that individuals should have full control over their digital identities and personal information.
- **Decentralisation as Empowerment**: The system is designed to eliminate single points of failure and the risk of centralised data breaches, aligning with the principles of a free, empowered individual.

## Limitations and Future Directions
- **Persistence**: The current implementation lacks the persistence of keys and proofs, which is essential for real-world applications.
- **Authentication Mechanism**: The system needs to implement a robust authentication mechanism that involves a user-specific challenge and a response mechanism.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Future iterations will involve actual blockchain technology for a tamper-proof, verifiable ledger.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Virtual Environment Setup
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects:

```bash
python3 -m venv identity_env
source identity_env/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
identity_env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### Dependency Installation
Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
pip install pycryptodome
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server by running the Python script.

    ```bash
    python DecentralIDServer.py
    ```

2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Click the "Verify My Identity" button to simulate the identity verification process.
